○ What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?
I have choosen a NOSQL database callaed mongodb.I have choosen mongodb because of its type of data model,which is a document store.I have
found it intresting because it doesnot require any schema.I think because of its document store model, I have really found really very easy
to insert the data.I have also found that  mongodb can be used for large data sets, as it can store data in the form of document objects.
The world requires technologies like these as the data sets are growing day-by-day.So, this particular use of mongo made me fascinated to
choose that one for my data base.
○ What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
I have found it really easy for displaying table in the front end by using jquery(ajax calls). As, I have got familiar with this class it is becoming 
easier for me to do this stuff right now. I have found that as easy part of my project.
○ What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
Initially, I was having troubles regarding loading each record with one ajax request.I have reaserched internet and found a solution that problem 
by addind id element in the get request and it retrives the data according to that id.For getting that idea I have taken alot of time. That 
is the part of implentation which I have found it hard.
○ If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
As I am using node.js for my server side scripting, concurrency would be my concern. As node.js is single threaded programming language
it cannot support concurrency. We only have to figure out about habndling concuurency.My other concern would be its lack failure tolerant 
machanisms.As I am using mongodb for my database, my concern would be regardind its querining that is lack of joins.Also because of its document
model, almost every tuple needs same space even it is not having some of the values. This would not have any affect when it comes storing 
small data but when it comes to large data, it will be a big problem. It is because of its memory it is using to store null values.So these are 
my primary concerns when it comes to choosing these platforms professionally.
